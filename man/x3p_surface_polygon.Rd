\title{Add a polygon of the scan shape as mask}
\usage{
x3p_surface_polygon(
  x3p,
  colour = "red",
  sample = 10,
  center = NULL,
  concavity = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x3p}{x3p file}

\item{colour}{colour for the polygon}

\item{sample}{strictly positive integer value specifying the amount of
downsampling to be used (see `x3p_sample`) to calculate the boundary points
of the polygon. Larger values of `sample` will result in faster response times
but results in less accurate polygons.}

\item{center}{point on the center of the scan. If NULL, a center will be
derived from the boundary points}

\item{concavity}{strictly positive value used in `concaveman::concaveman`}
}
\value{
x3p object with mask
}
