\title{Identify boundary of a 3d topographic scan in x3p format}
\usage{
x3p_boundary_points(x3p, sample)
}
\arguments{
\item{x3p}{topographic scan in x3p format}

\item{sample}{positive integer value specifying the sampling ratio:
every `sample` value in x and y direction will be included.
Higher values result in faster results but cruder assessments of the boundary.}
}
\value{
data frame of boundary points, variables are named `x` and `y`
}
